## COMPLETED

| project | date | mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| 02-retrieval-eval | 2026-08-25 | from-scratch okapi bm25 (lucene idf, k1 tf saturation, b length norm) vs sklearn-style tf-idf cosine (raw tf, smooth idf, l2 norm); evaluated with recall@1/recall@5/mrr@10 over a committed 40-doc / 38-query golden dataset, per-query head-to-head by reciprocal rank, plus a b=0 ablation isolating length normalization (mrr 0.917 tf-idf / 0.934 bm25 / 0.893 b=0); dataset includes engineered kitchen-sink distractor docs and deliberate vocabulary-mismatch queries to show where lexical retrieval fails |
| 01-structured-output | 2026-08-25 | layered JSON parse repair (fence strip, balanced-brace extraction, trailing-comma removal, python-literal fallback) + pydantic schema validation with a validation-error-feedback retry loop and hard-failure policy; benchmarked strict vs lenient vs full retry on 30 scripted-failure tickets (20.0% → 60.0% → 96.7%, 44 llm calls vs 30) |
